# DinoRun
A remake of the 2D Google game that appears when there is no internet available. 
This was done in Unity and for my own learning. Arrow keys control the dinosaur and the space bar allows him to jump. 
Infinite running is achieved by looping the background images and randomly spawining enemies. 

Assets: Sprites taken from google images.
